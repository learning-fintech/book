For example, if you have information about a firm's cost of capital, storing that information in a variable named `x` is a horrible idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always strive to make your code *readable*.  What this means is that it should be relatively easy to open up code that your wrote earlier and know what it does.  Adding inteligent variable names helps tremendously.  Consider the following example:\n",
