The literal interpretation of `'` is that it represents a single quote.  We can \"escape\" from this literal interpretation of a character by prefacing that character with `\\`.  The `\\` symbol tells Python to treat the information following the `\\` specially.  In the example here, `\\'` will tell Python that the `'` character is to be treated as part of the data, rather than a potential end for a single quoted string."

Note that the third character in this latter example is an escape character `'\\n`' rather than an alphanumeric character (the letters `'a'`-`'z'` or numbers `'0'`-`'9'`) or a symbol (e.g. `'!'`, `'@'`, or `'#'`).\n",

We will work with the examples `'AAPL Stock'` and `'F Stock'` for a moment.  These two strings are items that we may come accross in a written document.  Suppose that we need to extract the ticker names from these strings.  For instance, if these strings are items that we've extracted from a news article or a tweet, then finding the ticker names helps us determine what the subject of the article/tweet is.\n",

Hence, the first character is character $0$, the second character is character number $1$, etc.  We can select character number $n$ with square brackets that follow immediately after the string name."
