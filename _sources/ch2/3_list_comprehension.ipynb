    "When the `for` loop operation is only a single line long, there is a special shortcut that we can use.  This shortcut is called **list comprehension**.  Consider the task of subtracting the risk free rate from the list of daily returns in order to compute an excess return.  For simplicity, assume the risk free rate is constant and equal to $0.01$.  One way of achieving this is with the following `for` loop."

In that scenario, the `for` loop won't execute as intended, since it will still only calculate excess returns for the first five days.\n",
