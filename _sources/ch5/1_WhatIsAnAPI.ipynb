    "\n",
    "In a later module, we'll cover web scraping (accessing website data).  There, our goal is to instruct Python to visit a web page and download some data.  The procedure is to have Python mimic human behavior.  That is, Python visits a URL (as a human would), read over the page (as a human would), and then acquire data (again, as a human would).  For instance, a web scraping task might be to tell Python to go to Wikipedia and look up the date Elon Musk was born.  Python would go to the relevant web page on Wikipedia, read over the HTML, and extract the data (determine Musk's birth date).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with web scraping is that it is unnecessarily complicated.  While, at least for many sites, scraping is not terribly difficult, it's more than is needed.  Ultimately, the fundamental difficulty of scraping is that we're taking effort to teach Python how to be human.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easier solution, when available, is to use an Application Programming Interface (API) to collect web data.  Not every website has an API, but many do.  Essentially, an API is a method for Python to access the data on a website without needing to be instructed in how to replicate human behavior.  This is because an API is a special interface, designed for programmers, to connect their programs to the website of interest.  You may think of an API as the way a program is intended to \"read\" a website (as opposed to how humans read websites).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the chapter, we'll look at two simple APIs.  Many APIs that exist will follow the structure of those presented here, but with additional features.  At the end of this chapter, we'll use an API provided by the U.S. Census to access some demographic data and combine that data with home prices."
