# Financial Modeling and Analytics
  
This book is under development. It builds off of the last several years of lecture notes for the FIN 4820 course at LSU.

**Concept Checks**

Throught the book, you will encounter the text:

<span style="color:red">**Concept check**:</span> &lt;some text here&gt;

followed by a cell that beings with
```
# complete concept check here
```
These cells are meant to be completed by the reader. You will need to open the book's notebook in an interactive environment (e.g.Â Google Colab) to execute code yourself and complete the concept checks.
