    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are one of the two fundamental components of any programming language.  Now that we know what variables are (they things that store data) and how to work with them, we can introduce the the other fundamental component of programming: functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions give us the ability to write some code that we reference over and over again without having to retype things.  Ultimately, programming is about making your life easier!  We work hard (say, for one semester of our lives) learning how to give a computer instructions (using Python) and then, for the rest of our lives, everything else is easier and more convenient because we can instruct a computer to do lots of the heavy lifting for us.  <u>In financial terms, we spend a little time now for a bunch of time saved later, and thus the net present value of learning to program is positive.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions have three parts:\n",
    "1. Function defintion (name the function and determine what *inputs* we need, if any)\n",
    "2. Operations (execute some code)\n",
    "3. Return statement (define what want we want to get back from the function)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's compute the weighted average cost of capital, defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{\\text{WACC}} = \\frac{E}{V}\\times r_E + \\frac{D}{V}\\times r_D\\times (1-\\tau_C).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the weighted average cost of capital for a firm is the proportion of equity in the firm times the equity cost of capital plus the proportion of debt in the firm times the debt cost of capital.  We adjust the latter for the tax shield of debt using the corporate tax rate $\\tau_C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A function defintion begins with the keyword `def` followed by the function name and then a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can use information passed to it via input arguments (inputs are named in the parentheses, which appear before the colon).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "def wacc(E, D, rE, rD, tC):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this function definition, we expect `E` and `D` as inputs.  We do not require `V` to be an input to the function, since `V` is easily calculated as `V = E + D`.  This calculation is included in part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions run the code written inside of the function (operations) when the function is *called*.  A function call occurs when a programmer ''uses'' the function, and we'll see an example of this shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>NOTE</u>: indentation keeps track of whether code is ''inside'' a function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "def wacc(E, D, rE, rD, tC):\n",
    "    V = E + D\n",
    "    cost_of_capital = E / V * rE + D / V * rD * (1 - tC)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: return value**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be many, many lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line, starting with the keyword `return` specifies what value comes back when you run the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "def wacc(E, D, rE, rD, tC):\n",
    "    V = E + D\n",
    "    cost_of_capital = E / V * rE + D / V * rD * (1 - tC)\n",
    "    return cost_of_capital\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is created, Python becomes ''aware'' of the function, but nothing else happens at that time."

    "Do not insert exceptions to your functions unnecessarily.  Only rely on financial principles to make these judgements.  It is obvious, for example, that costs of capital should not be negative.  Moreover, the second Modigliani and Miller proposition tells us that `rE` should always be at least as high as `rD`, so we could raise an exception if `rE <= rD`.  However, there is no strict rule, either by regulation or by principles of finance, that debt value cannot exceed equity value.  For some smaller firms, it may very well be that leverage exceeds 50%.  However, if you write the `better_wacc()` function and anticipate that it will only be used on large, S\\&P 500 companies, it may make sense to check whether `E > D`.  In this case, raising an exception would not be appropriate.  However, since we would generally expect that equity value should exceed debt value, it may make sense to print a warning message for the user."
