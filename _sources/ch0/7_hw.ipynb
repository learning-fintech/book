    "In finance, we value a stream of future cash flows by discounting these to the present period.  For example, suppose a division manager at a firm wishes to determine whether a new investment project is worth purusing.  How should the manager make this decision?  One method to do this is with net present value (NPV).  Another is with internal rate of return (IRR).  You should have heard of both of these before, and will probably remember that NPV is the preferred approach.  As your first Python exercise, you'll get to prove to/remind yourself why one should *not* use IRR.\n",

To see what's going wrong here, recall tha the IRR is the discount rate that sets the cash flow stream to zero net present value.  In the `np.irr()` call above, Python returned an IRR to you.  But it's not the only possible IRR for this problem!  Mathematically, certain cash flow streams can have *multiple* IRRs that would set the cash flow stream to zero net present value.  To see this happen, plot the NPV for this cash flow stream over a range of possible discount rates (you'll find two that set the NPV to zero, one was the answer that `np.irr()` gave you above).  For this problem, you should include discount rates over the range $[0.01,0.51]$.\n",
