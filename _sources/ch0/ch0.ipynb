However, to be useful, the function needs to be planned carefully.  If the function is written well, then you can use it conveniently in the future without worrying about the details.  However, if the function is written poorly, it could end up creating a huge headache for you when you try to use it later.\n",

Thus, we collect all the requisite components to calculating a weighted average cost of capital, as well as information about the current free cash flow and an expected growth rate to the free cash flow.  For simplicity, assume that free cash flow growth and the risk free rate of capital are constant.  In this scenario, we can apply the Gordon growth formula to value the company.\n",

    "Do not insert exceptions to your functions unnecessarily.  Only rely on financial principles to make these judgements.  It is obvious, for example, that costs of capital should not be negative.  Moreover, the second Modigliani and Miller proposition tells us that `rE` should always be at least as high as `rD`, so we could raise an exception if `rE <= rD`.  However, there is no strict rule, either by regulation or by principles of finance, that debt value cannot exceed equity value.  For some smaller firms, it may very well be that leverage exceeds 50%.  However, if you write the `better_wacc()` function and anticipate that it will only be used on large, S\\&P 500 companies, it may make sense to check whether `E > D`.  In this case, raising an exception would not be appropriate.  However, since we would generally expect that equity value should exceed debt value, it may make sense to print a warning message for the user."
