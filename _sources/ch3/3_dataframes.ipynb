    "\n",
    "For the sake of continuity, the daily stock return data will match that of the previous section, so that the keys in `daily_dict` correspond to $\\text{Date}$ and the valeus in `daily_dict` correspond to $r_{i,t}$ in the table below.  Now let's add in information on the market return and the risk free rate.\n",

    "| Date | $r_i$ | $r_m$ | $r_f$ |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",

    "\n",
    "The question becomes: how do we store this information in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate at a CAPM equation (which is covered in the next chapter), we will need to be able to reference $r_{i,t}$, $r_{m,t}$, and $r_{f,t}$ individually, and tell Python what to do with each of these series of returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use lists to keep track of everything then we will have the following:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "r_i = [0.03, 0.01, -0.02, 0.01, -0.01]\n",
    "r_m = [0.02, 0.01, -0.03, 0.02, -0.03]\n",
    "r_f = [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01]\n",
    "t = ['7/8/19', '7/9/19', '7/10/19', '7/11/19', '7/12/19']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bad practice for at least a couple of reasons.  First, one has to be extremely careful that the data line up properly so that `r_i[k]`, `r_m[k]`, and `r_f[k]` correspond to returns on the same date for every `k`.  Suppose that there is some missing data for some firm $j$ such that `r_j = [0.05, 0.02, 0.03, -0.04]`.  Without any additional information, it is impossible to track down which data point for firm $j$ is missing.  Second, it's difficult to reference returns at a particular date.  Suppose that you want to know the market return on `7/11/19`.  You would first have to determine that `t[k] = '7/11/19'` when `k = 3` and then go look up `r_m[3]` to get the market return.  Note that neither of these considerations imply that it is impossible to use lists to hold all the requisite data, it's just inconvenient for the programmer.  Remember, Python is supposed to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose instead that we use a dictionary based approach to hold all of the data.  One way to do this is to construct a *nested dictionary*.  Nested dictionaries look like:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "nested_dict = {'finance':\n",
    "                {'verb':'to supply with money or capital',\n",
    "                 'noun':'the management of revenues'},\n",
    "               'rate':\n",
    "                {'verb':'to estimate the value or worth of',\n",
    "                 'noun':'the amount of a charge or payment with reference to some basis of calculation'}\n",
    "              }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here there is a dictionary with keys `'finance'` and `'rate'`.  The key `'finance'` has a value which is itself a dictionary: one key named `'verb'` which has value equal to the definition of \"finance\" used as a verb and another key named `'noun'` which has value equal to the definition of \"finance\" used as a noun.  Likewise the key `'rate'` has a value which is itself a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one enters `nested_dict['finance']`, Python will return the dictionary `{'verb':'to supply with money or capital', 'noun':'the management of revenues'}`.  Thus, to look up what the noun usage of \"finance\" is, one simply types `nested_dict['finance']['noun']`, which tells Python to look up the `noun` value to the dictionary value given by the key `'finance'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the conext of the current problem, a nested dictionary might look like:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "daily_returns = {'r_i': {'7/8/19':0.03, '7/9/19':0.01, '7/10/19':-0.02, '7/11/19':0.01, '7/12/19':-0.01},\n",
    "                 'r_m': {'7/8/19':0.02, '7/9/19':0.01, '7/10/19':-0.03, '7/11/19':0.02, '7/12/19':-0.03},\n",
    "                 'r_f': {'7/8/19':0.01, '7/9/19':0.01, '7/10/19':0.01, '7/11/19':0.01, '7/12/19':0.01}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The dictionary approach adds a convenience to the problem.  Now, if one wants to look up the market return on `7/11/19` one simply has to type `daily_returns['r_m']['7/11/19']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this approach still isn't perfect.  Remember, CAPM tells us that the excess return $r_{i,t}-r_{f,t}$ is defined by a linear function of the market risk premium $r_{m,t}-r_{f,t}$.  Therefore, what we want to do is to be able to tell Python to calculate the excess return and the market risk premium.  This is doable with a nested dictionary format, but it's a little complicated.  One would have to do something like the following (feel free to skip this code):\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "daily_returns['r_excess'] = {}\n",
    "daily_returns['r_riskpremium'] = {}\n",
    "for t in daily_returns['r_f'].values():\n",
    "    daily_returns['r_excess'].update(t:daily_returns['r_i'][t]-daily_returns['r_f'][t])\n",
    "    daily_returns['r_riskpremium'].update(t:daily_returns['r_m'][t]-daily_returns['r_f'][t])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is five long lines of code.  That means lots of typing and plenty of room for typos.  Nested dictionaries are *not* the recommended way to hold and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what *is* the recommended way to hold data in Python?  We need to use pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is the standard module for working with datasets in Python, written by Wes McKinney while at AQR Capital Management.  A **module** is a collection of user-defined functions, written by one or more people, and made available for use by everyone.  The `wacc()` function from earlier in this chapter is an example of a user-defined function.  When a set of userful and related functions are created, the author(s) of these functions sometimes choose to share this set of functions with the world to make Python an even more convenient language for everyone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules that are not part of the standard Python library need to be **imported** using an import statement like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above, the module `pandas` is imported.  What this means is that now the functions available under `pandas` are available for you to use.  If you do not import the pandas module, the functions inside of it are unkown to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reference the functions inside of the `pandas` module, we use `pandas.<function_name>()`.  For example, `pandas` has a function called `read_csv()`, so we would use this function by typing `pandas.read_csv()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some modules, like `numpy` or `pandas` that are so frequently used in Python programming, they have unofficial ''standard'' ways of importing the module with an abbreviation for our later convience.  Two examples are given below:"

    "Now, instead of having to type `pandas.read_csv()` as before, we simply refer to `pandas` by its nickname and type `pd.read_csv()`.  It may not seem like a huge shortcut, but it's a very common.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `pandas` for a lot of our work in this class.  Note that tutorials and recipes (example pieces of code to perform fairly common tasks) are easy to find [online](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock return data that we will use is included with this handout, so we will read the data from CoCalc.  This highlights two important features of the `read_csv()` function.  First, it can pull files from a website directly (as long as the file is formatted as a csv file).  Second, it can read compressed files (note that the file name used here ends with `.gz`, a type of file compression).  File compression is an important option because of the convenience it provides.  Note that the stock data we have here would be too large to be allowed to be hosted for free on GitHub if the file were not compressed.  Moreover, other cloud-based storage solutions like Amazon S3 will charge based on the amount of storage you request, so having the ability to use compressed files means you spend less money on storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read_csv()` function *returns* a value.  The type of that value is not a number, string, list, or dictionary, but rather a pandas-specific variable type called a **DataFrame**.  In a moment, you'll see what one looks like.  DataFrames are essentially a nested dictionary type of structure, but with a ton of convenience features added in to make them easy to work with.  For now, use the `.read_csv()` function and then tell Python that the returned value should be set to a variable named `data`."

This is because the first row of data (row 2, in Excel) is read in an by default given the name `0` by Python (because Python starts counting at zero).  Hence, we could refer to a row based on this name, just like we do with a column name.  Note that if you type `data[0]`, Python will get confused.  The name inside square brackets is, according to pandas' rules for DataFrame variables, expected to be a column name and not a row name.  For the moment, let's skip over how to refer to the first row of data by using the name `0` printed on the left hand side of the printout above.\n",
