    "* list\n",
    "* dict\n",
    "* DataFrame\n",

    "and we will discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each type here.\n",

    "Lists are the easiest way to deal with data, but they're also the most limited.  For instance, what does `daily_stock_returns[2]` refer to?  We know that it has value $-0.02$, since that's the third element of the list.  But without any other reference point, the utility of this data is low.  We don't know, for instance, what date corresponds to list index value 2.  We also don't know which stock's returns are represented in this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, lists keep track of a very limited amount of information.  They are simple and convenient, and we'll use them as appropriate.  Lists are a fundamental tool, and we'll never do away with them entirely.  However, for certain applications, better tools exist.\n",

    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are quick and convenient.  No matter how advanced you get in programming, you will always make use of lists.  However, lists aren't the best tool for every job.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one limitation of lists is that we have to refer to items by their position in the list.  If we type `daily_stock_returns[0]`, we'd get the stock return for the first item in the list.  But what is `0`?  Besides a relative positioning, it doesn't tell us anything.  In some cases, it would be better if we could access other information, like the date of the stock return.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, a `dictionary` is a tool for storing information in a *key-value* structure.  Have a look at the following dictionary, and we'll use it to clarify what is meant by \"key-value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "finance_dict = {'debt': 'something that is owed or that one is bound to pay to or perform for another',\n",
    "                'equity': 'the monetary value of a property or business beyond any amounts owed on it in mortgages, claims, liens, etc.'\n",
    "                'mortgage': 'a conveyance of an interest in property as security for the repayment of money borrowed'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These words (definitions taken from dictionary.com), make up a small dictionary variable which we've named `finance_dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word in the dictionary (`debt`, `equity`, `mortgage`) constitutes a *key*.  We \"look up\" keys in dictionaries to find their *values*.  Thus, the key is a word and the value is the definition.  The command\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "finance_dict['debt']\n",
    "```\n",
    "would return the definition for debt.\n",

We'll see later that lists are flexible and that makes them quite convenient to use.  However, in this case, the flexibility of a list is tricky.  Lists can store elements of different types, so if we used `.append( [.02, -.01] )` then Python would as a list element to the pre-existing list of numbers.  The following example clarifies."
